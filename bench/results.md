## Notes

- Machine: 24 cores, 43 GB RAM, local NVMe; each run is one process with 4 dask threads (`bench/run_one.py`).
  Wall time varies by about ±5 s between repeats. Two extra repeats of s4 gave baseline 17.3 s / 22.5 s
  against optimized 14.9 s / 18.6 s, so the 1.28× in the table above is within noise; peak RSS and
  chunk GETs are stable across repeats.
- Chunk GETs are the metric that transfers to S3, where every partial-shard read is one range request.
- s3 writes more shard files by design: shards are one time slice each (change 6), which bounds task
  memory by `spatial_chunk²` instead of growing with the time dimension.
- Output comparison (`bench/compare_outputs.py`): s1 (min) and s4 (median) are identical at every level.
  s2 and s3 (mean on uint8) differ by at most 1 per level, compounding to 4 at level 6, because the
  baseline truncated integer means (change 10). All shapes here are powers of two, so pixel sizes agree.
